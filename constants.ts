    2.  **Isolated Evidence:** Find a crucial piece of evidence that isn't linked to any argument.
    3.  **High-Impact Charges:** Find a "Charge" node that is well-supported by evidence and linked to a core strategic "Goal". This is a point of leverage.
    4.  **Unconnected Goals:** Find a strategic "Goal" that has no supporting arguments.
    
    EXAMPLE INSIGHT:
    "Your strategic argument 'Document unauthorized surveillance' is critically weak, with no direct evidence linked to it. This is a major vulnerability. Your immediate priority should be to locate and link any emails, logs, or reports that can substantiate this claim to prevent it from being dismissed."
