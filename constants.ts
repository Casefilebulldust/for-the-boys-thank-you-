    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1.  Analyze the connections (or lack thereof) between Evidence, Arguments, Goals, and Charges.
    2.  Identify the MOST CRITICAL strategic vulnerability or opportunity.
    3.  Provide a concise, actionable insight as a single paragraph.
    
    PRIORITY OF INSIGHTS:
    1.  **Weakly Supported Arguments:** Find an important argument with little or no linked evidence.
    2.  **Isolated Evidence:** Find a crucial piece of evidence that isn't linked to any argument.
    3.  **High-Impact Charges:** Find a "Charge" node that is well-supported by evidence and linked to a core strategic "Goal". This is a point of leverage.
    4.  **Unconnected Goals:** Find a strategic "Goal" that has no supporting arguments.
    
    EXAMPLE INSIGHT:
    "Your strategic argument 'Document unauthorized surveillance' is critically weak, with no direct evidence linked to it. This is a major vulnerability. Your immediate priority should be to locate and link any emails, logs, or reports that can substantiate this claim to prevent it from being dismissed."

This inaction likely led to the spoliation of critical digital evidence, directly hindering the ability to prove technology-facilitated domestic violence and perverting the course of justice.
